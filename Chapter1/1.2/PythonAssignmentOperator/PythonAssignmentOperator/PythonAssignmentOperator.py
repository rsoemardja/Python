#This Module will Cover Assignment Operators Variables

# x is the variable
# = is the assignment operator (what it Equals to
# 5 is the expression and will assign it to the variable
x = 5

# This Will print the value that is store in the variable x
print(x)

# This prints the letter, but not the value in the variable x
print("x")

# This is an assignment operator in math this is illegal (not allowed)
# The x is the variable
# The = is the assignment operator
# and the x+1 is the mathmatical expression
x = x+1
# It will print x as the solution to the variable
print (x)
x+1

# The value will not Change it will be stored variable
print (x)

# The Only way to change the Number in the varible is to add an expression to change the value
#  x it will add a value to x to give the result
x = x+1
print(x)

#This is not a valid expression because it not a vaild to assign it to a operator as a variable
# The front HAS to be a variable 
# you can flip it math but the the rules in programming are explicit in this context
x+1 = x

# This Expression and the Second Expression are equivalent to each other
x = x+1
print (x)

x += 1
print (x)
# you can minus in the equaltion and it is equvalent as well
x -= 3
print (x)
