#these are example for equations that are hard to read for the average person
#this code would be generally hard to understand
m=294/10.5
print(m)

#This formula is same but we are adding more variables to the equation
#this code is still hard to understand
m=294
g=10.5
#This value is the same as m=294/10.5
m2=m/g
print(m2)

#If i want to change the value of m and g to a new value i could do so here
#I could simply do the same formula without changing anything and but the values change because the varibles changed
#But this not a ideal programming environment because other people cannot read what you are writing
m=402
g=12
m2=m/g

# You can write long name variables so it can become easy to understand by simply doing the following
# What's great about this line of code is the fact that this code is self documented
# The fact that i could look at the code and have a general understanding of the variable and the values
# The fact that we are using longer words makes it more genrally easier to understand
