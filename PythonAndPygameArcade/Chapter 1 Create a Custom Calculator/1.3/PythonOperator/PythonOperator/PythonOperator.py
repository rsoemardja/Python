# This is an Operator
3+2
x=2
3+x
# We cant do 3 +y because we don't know what why is and y hasn't been assigned as a variable
3+y
# now y has been assigned as a variable
y=10
# It is now a valid expression and it give a solution
3+y

# We can Do Minus Operators
5-2

# We can Multiply Operators
5*3

#Juxtapositioning an expression does not work
5x
# but Multiplying it DOES work
5*x

# This Works in Math
# But the Computer is Confused by what integer that you are calling
5(3-2)
# BUT if you Multiply it then the function works
# but by putting an * you are Multiplying the expression
5*(3-2)

# You can Divide the expression
6/3
# You can Divide incomplete math expressions
7/2

# This is a floor Division Expression
# It is commonly used for graphs, shapes and measuring images
# And it will give a rounded integer result
7//2
# This will give a 3 with the floor expression as it will round the number
10//3
# This will also give a 3
11//3
# This will give a f4 with the floor division expression as this is a complete expression
12//3
# The floor expression will not round up the number it will round down to the nearest whole number
199//200
# Likewise
199//100
# and Likewise
200//100

# You can use this operator in other languages to root the expression 
# But this does not work in Python 
# The ^ os a "bitwise or"
2^16

# This will Root the Expression
2**16
# This is many more examples
1**8
2**8
10**4

#This is a modulus operator
# It will devide the expression and see if their is anything remaining
# This expression will have nothing remaining as this is a complete equation
6%2
# Their should be a remainder on this modulus operator
7&2
# A Modulus Operator is Useful for when you are making a loop
# it can also acts a counter for when it makes a loop
1%5
2&5

# In this Scenario it Will Divide The Equation 1st then Add it all together
90+86+71+100+98/5
# Order of Operations Is key in the context of programming
#  If You Parentheses for what you want for the order of operations
(90+86+71+100+98)/5

# This is incorrect as sin is not a defined expression
sin(3.14)

#This will import math functions
from math import *
# and now the sin function will work
sin(3.14)
