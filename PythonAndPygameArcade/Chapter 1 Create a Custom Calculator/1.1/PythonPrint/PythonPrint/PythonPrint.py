# This is a Function it can be numbers but it can also be text
print ("Hello World!")
#This is a fucnction and it print out the expression as "Learning Python is great!"
print ("Learning Python is great!")
#This is a Text instead of the mathematical it will print out as 10+10 since it is in ""
print ("10+10")
# This will print out as a mathematical Expression/Function and it will act as 10+10=20
print (10+10)
# this will print as mathematical expression and will print out as 80 due to the mathematical order of operations
print ( 10+10-5*20 )
# This is incorrect as this is trying to output a mathematical parameter and the it will say that the syntax is incorrect
# This is a Common Error
print (Hello World!)
# I Have Combined the Expression and the Mathematical parameter and it will print out accordingly
# 1. It will print out the Expression
# 2. the , will act as a spacebar and it will print the 2nd parameter
print ("The answer to 10+10 is", 10+10)
# It will print out 5 parameters with spaces in between
print (3,4,5,6,4)
# if you want to print this parameter you NEED to a , to your expression 
# This is a Common Error
print (3 4)
# This is an example of a Common Error due to the fact that their is no , in the function
print ("The answer to 5+5 is" 5+5)
# This is also a Common Error due to the fact that the , is in the "" of the Expression of the function
print ("The answer is," 5+5 )
# This is the Correct Method
print ("The answer to 5+5 is,", 5+5)

# SUMMARY
# This is the print command this is our function
print
# Followed by the Parenthesis ()
print ()
# Followed by the Data That wants to come out, 
# If we include double Quotes/Quotations The Computer Will Out Exactly What was written between the ""
print ("Hello there!")
# If we have Multiple we can separate them by commas ,
print ("Hello there!", 5,42,69)
